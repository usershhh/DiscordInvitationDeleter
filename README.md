# DiscordInvitationDeleter
This program allows you to delete all the invitations that people have created on your discord server using a bot. You may find this useful if you have been in my situation, too many invitations have been created on my discord server, which was blocking the creation of new invitations.

1) Put the token of your discord bot in the "TOKEN" variable, don't forget to put the id of your discord server in the "SERVER_ID" variable **without quotes**.
2) Install the discord library with the following command: **pip3 install discord.py**
3) Run the script as follows: python3 deleteinvites.py
